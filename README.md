# Image Analysis and Patter Recognition - EPFL 2020

This repository contains my work for the course Image Analysis and Pattern Recognition (EE-451.

# Directories:
- Labs: 
  - lab_01_segmentation.ipynb
  - lab_02_object_description.ipynb
  - lab_03_classification.ipynb
- Project: 
  The project consits of designing an algorithm that takes as input a top view video of a robot that moves above some handwritten digits and mathematical operations.
  The goal is to translate the robot's movement into an equation and compute its result. These results are printed directly on the output video.
- LeNet_model:
  contains the CNN model we trained to classify the handwritten digits.
